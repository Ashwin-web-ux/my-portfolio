  Hey! I’m a frontend developer who loves turning ideas into clean, responsive websites. I’ve been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React—and I’m really enjoying the process.

<p className='text-xl'>
  Right now, I’m focused on improving my React skills and learning more about modern frontend tools. I’m always excited to build cool stuff, take on new challenges, and keep growing as a developer.
